CKA vs CKAD vs CKS â€“ What is the Difference

What is Kubernetes?
It is an open-source container orchestration tool. It has become the standard for managing containerized applications at scale. Consequently, many companies have adopted Kubernetes, leading to an upsurge in the demand for professionals who can deploy, manage, and resolve issues with Kubernetes clusters. This has resulted in higher salaries and abundant job opportunities for Kubernetes experts, making it a highly desired skill-set in the tech industry.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) offers multiple Kubernetes certifications:

Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD): Validates technical skills in building and deploying applications

Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA): Validates technical skills in general maintenance and management of entire Kubernetes clusters

Certified Kubernetes Security (CKS): Validates technical skills in securing containers and the cluster.

Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA): A pre-professional certification that validates one's understanding of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.
