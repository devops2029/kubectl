Certified Kubernetes Security (CKS)
The CKS certification is intended to validate a candidate's knowledge and proficiency in securing Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications. The exam covers a broad range of topics related to Kubernetes security best practices, including cluster setup, Kubernetes security, secure container lifecycle management, security auditing and monitoring, network security, and security tool utilization.

The first topic, cluster setup, involves configuring Kubernetes clusters with security in mind, such as configuring network policies, securing etcd, and using secure communications.

The second topic, cluster hardening, ensures that the candidate understands the Kubernetes security model, including pod security policies, service accounts, and role-based access controls (RBAC).

The third topic, secure container lifecycle management, emphasizes the importance of securely building, deploying, and managing container images and containers using Kubernetes best practices.

The fourth topic, security auditing and monitoring, involves performing security audits and monitoring Kubernetes clusters for security vulnerabilities.

The fifth topic, network security, covers securing Kubernetes network traffic with network policies and other security mechanisms.

The sixth topic, security tools, includes understanding how to use Kubernetes security tools such as Falco, Sysdig, and other security-related add-ons.

Obtaining the CKS certification can demonstrate to potential employers that the candidate has the necessary skills and expertise to secure Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications, making them a valuable asset to any organization that uses Kubernetes.
